Kibojoe Linux is a re-spin of Manjaro Linux always maintained collaboratively. It is mainly targetted at people who are new to WMs, or experienced people who want to have a fully functional system after the installation. This project is still in heavy development, so things might change a lot with each release. Even though the current release is labeled as dev, it should be stable enough to work on an actual system. If you've tested this release, please share your feedback so we can keep improving this re-spin of the Manjaro Linux.
